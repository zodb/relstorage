1.4.0b1 (2009-11-17)
--------------------

- Added the keep-history option. Set it to false to keep no history.
  (Packing is still required for garbage collection and blob deletion.)

- Added the replica-conf and replica-timeout options.  Set replica-conf
  to a filename containing the location of database replicas.  Changes
  to the file take effect at transaction boundaries.

- Expanded the option documentation in README.txt.

- Revised the way RelStorage uses memcached.  Minimized the number of
  trips to both the cache server and the database.

- Added an in-process pickle cache that serves a function similar to the
  ZEO cache.

- Added a wrapper module for pylibmc.

- Store operations now use multi-insert and multi-delete SQL
  statements to reduce the effect of network latency.

- Renamed relstorage.py to storage.py to overcome import issues.
  Also moved the Options class to options.py.

- Updated the patch for ZODB 3.7 and 3.8 to fix an issue with
  blobs and subtransactions.

- Divided the implementation of database adapters into many small
  objects, making the adapter code more modular.  Added interfaces
  that describe the duties of each part.

- Oracle: Sped up restore operations by sending short blobs inline.

- Oracle: Use a timeout on commit locks.  This requires installation
  of a small PL/SQL package that can access DBMS_LOCK.  See README.txt.

- Oracle: Used PL/SQL bulk insert operations to improve write
  performance.

- PostgreSQL: use the documented ALTER SEQUENCE RESTART WITH
  statement instead of ALTER SEQUENCE START WITH.

- Moved MD5 sum computation to the adapters so they can choose not
  to use MD5.

- Changed loadSerial to load from the store connection only if the
  load connection can not provide the object requested.

- Stopped wrapping database disconnect exceptions.  Now the code
  catches and handles them directly.

- Use the store connection rather than the load connection for OID
  allocation.

- Detect and handle backward time travel, which can happen after
  failover to an out-of-date asynchronous slave database. For
  simplicity, invalidate the whole ZODB cache when this happens.

- Replaced the speed test script with a separately distributed package,
  ``zodbshootout``.

- Added the ``zodbpack`` script.

1.3.0b1 (2009-09-04)
--------------------

- Added support for a blob directory. No BlobStorage wrapper is needed.
  Cluster nodes will need to use a shared filesystem such as NFS or
  SMB/CIFS.

- Added the blob-dir parameter to the ZConfig schema and README.txt.


1.2.0 (2009-09-04)
------------------

- In Oracle, trim transaction descriptions longer than 2000 bytes.

- When opening the database for the first time, don't issue a warning
  about the inevitable POSKeyError on the root OID.

- If RelStorage tries to unpickle a corrupt object state during packing,
  it will now report the oid and tid in the log.


1.2.0b2 (2009-05-05)
--------------------

- RelStorage now implements IMVCCStorage, making it compatible with
  ZODB 3.9.0b1 and above.

- Removed two-phase commit support from the PostgreSQL adapter. The
  feature turned out to be unnecessary.

- Added MySQL 5.1.34 and above to the list of supportable databases.

- Fixed minor test failures under Windows. Windows is now a supportable
  platform.
