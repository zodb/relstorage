# setup-ENV likes to update ZODB. But RecoveryStorage can't import
# handle_serials in 5.0, and there are transaction changes that affect
# our tests in 4.3+ (checkUndoCreationBranch1). It's hard to write a requirement like this in
# setup.py because of the ZODB3 meta distribution being renamed back
# to ZODB.
  - pip uninstall -y ZODB
  - pip install 'ZODB<4.3'
