    # Oracle documentation, which says: "All subsequent queries in that
    # transaction see only changes that were committed before the
    # transaction began."
    #
    # See: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200

    #
    # This would be great for performance if we could rely on it.
    # It's like serializable isolation but with less locking.
    #
    # However, in testing an Oracle 10g RAC environment with
    # RelStorage, Oracle frequently leaked subsequently committed
    # transactions into a read only transaction, suggesting that read
    # only in RAC actually has read committed isolation rather than
    # serializable isolation. Switching to serializable mode solved the
    # problem. Using a DSN that specifies a particular RAC node did
    # *not* solve the problem. It's likely that this is a bug in RAC,
    # but let's be on the safe side and have all Oracle users apply
    # serializable mode instead of read only mode, since serializable
    # is more explicit.
    #
    # If anyone wants to try read only mode anyway, change the
    # class variable below.
