# magic_value wants you to not use arbitrary strings and numbers

# positives. Trust people to do the most readable thing.

# Empty comment would be good, except it detects blank lines within
# a single comment block.
#
# Those are often used to separate paragraphs, like here.

# consider_ternary_expression is a nice check, but is also overzealous.

# This wants you to turn ``x in (1, 2)`` into ``x in {1, 2}``.
# They both result in the LOAD_CONST bytecode, one a tuple one a
# frozenset. In theory a set lookup using hashing is faster than
# a linear scan of a tuple; but if the tuple is small, it can often
# actually be faster to scan the tuple.

# Fix zope.cachedescriptors.property.Lazy; the property-classes doesn't seem to
# do anything.

# For releases prior to 2.14.2, this needs to be a one-line, quoted string. After that,
# a multi-line string.
# - Make zope.cachedescriptors.property.Lazy look like a property;
#   fixes pylint thinking it is a method.
# - Run in Pure Python mode (ignore C extensions that respect this);
#   fixes some issues with zope.interface, like IFoo.providedby(ob)
#   claiming not to have the right number of parameters...except no, it does not.

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once).
# NOTE: comments must go ABOVE the statement. In Python 2, mixing in
# comments disables all directives that follow, while in Python 3, putting
# comments at the end of the line does the same thing (though Py3 supports
# mixing)

# too-many-positional-arguments: we inherit most of these and can't do anything about them.
# invalid-name, ; We get lots of these, especially in scripts. should fix many of them
# protected-access, ; We have many cases of this; legit ones need to be examinid and commented, then this removed
# no-self-use, ; common in superclasses with extension points
# too-few-public-methods, ; Exception and marker classes get tagged with this
# exec-used, ; should tag individual instances with this, there are some but not too many
# global-statement,     ; should tag individual instances
# multiple-statements, ; "from gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()"
# locally-disabled, ; yes, we know we're doing this. don't replace one warning with another
# cyclic-import, ; most of these are deferred imports
# too-many-arguments, ; these are almost always because that's what the stdlib does
# redefined-builtin, ; likewise: these tend to be keyword arguments like len= in the stdlib
# undefined-all-variable,     ; XXX: This crashes with pylint 1.5.4 on Travis (but not locally on Py2/3
#     ; or landscape.io on Py3). The file causing the problem is unclear. UPDATE: identified and disabled
#   that file.
#   see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/846
# useless-suppression: the only way to avoid repeating it for specific statements everywhere that we
#   do Py2/Py3 stuff is to put it here. Sadly this means that we might get better but not realize it.
# duplicate-code: Yeah, the compatibility ssl modules are much the same
# In pylint 1.8.0, inconsistent-return-statements are created for the wrong reasons.
# This code raises it, even though there is only one return (the implicit ``return None`` is presumably
# what triggers it):
#  def foo():
#    if baz:
#      return 1
# In Pylint 2dev1, needed for Python 3.7, we get spurious "useless return" errors:
# @property
# def foo(self):
#   return None # generates useless-return
# Pylint 2.4 adds import-outside-toplevel. But we do that a lot to defer imports because of patching.
# Pylint 2.4 adds self-assigning-variable. But we do *that* to avoid unused-import when we
# "export" the variable and dont have a __all__.
# Pylint 2.6+ adds some python-3-only things that dont apply: raise-missing-from, super-with-arguments, consider-using-f-string, redundant-u-string-prefix
# cyclic import is added because it pylint is spuriously detecting that
# consider-using-assignment-expr wants you to transform things like:
#   foo = get_foo()
#   if foo: ...
#
# Into ``if (foo := get_foo()):``
# But there are a *lot* of those. Trust people to do the right, most
# readable, thing

# XXX: unclear on the docstring warnings, missing-type-doc, missing-param-doc,

# unnecessary.
