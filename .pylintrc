[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once).
# NOTE: comments must go ABOVE the statement. In Python 2, mixing in
# comments disables all directives that follow, while in Python 3, putting
# comments at the end of the line does the same thing (though Py3 supports
# mixing)

# invalid-name, ; Things like loadBlob get flagged
# protected-access, ; We have many cases of this; legit ones need to be examinid and commented, then this removed
# no-self-use, ; common in superclasses with extension points
# too-few-public-methods, ; Exception and marker classes get tagged with this
# exec-used, ; should tag individual instances with this, there are some but not too many
# global-statement,     ; should tag individual instances
# multiple-statements, ; "from gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()"
# locally-disabled, ; yes, we know we're doing this. don't replace one warning with another
# cyclic-import, ; most of these are deferred imports
# too-many-arguments, ; these are almost always because that's what the stdlib does
# redefined-builtin, ; likewise: these tend to be keyword arguments like len= in the stdlib
# undefined-all-variable,     ; XXX: This crashes with pylint 1.5.4 on Travis (but not locally on Py2/3
#     ; or landscape.io on Py3). The file causing the problem is unclear. UPDATE: identified and disabled
#   that file.
#   see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/846
# useless-suppression: the only way to avoid repeating it for specific statements everywhere that we
#   do Py2/Py3 stuff is to put it here. Sadly this means that we might get better but not realize it.
# chained-comparison: It wants you to rewrite `x > 2 and x < 3` using something like `2 < x < 3`,
#   which I don't like, I find that less readable.
# import-outside-toplevel: New in pylint 2.4. We have a large number of deferred imports.
# super-with-arguments and raise-missing-from: New in pylint 2.7; we can't use them because
#   we support Python 2.
