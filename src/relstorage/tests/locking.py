        #
        # Prior to RelStorage 3.5, this was the sequence:
        # Three objects, 0, 1, 2.
        # Thee connections: A, B, C.
        # (1) Connection A takes a shared lock on object 0, 1, and 2.
        #     Object 0 is used as as stop point to control the other transactions.
        #
        # (2) Connection B begins the regular commit sequence:
        #     shared lock on object 1, exclusive lock on object 0 and 2.
        #     It will be prevented from getting this by Connection A, and block.
        #
        # (3) Connection C begins the regular commit sequence:
        #     shared lock on object 2 (which it should get),
        #     exclusive lock on object 0 and 1. This is held by both A and B.
        #
        # (4) Connection A aborts, releasing its shared locks.
        #     Connection B is free to move forward and try to take the lock on
        #     2; it is prevented by Connection C.
        #     Connection C, meanwhile is prevented from getting the exclusive lock
        #     on object 1 by the shared locke held by connection B. B and C
        #     are deadlocked. One of B or C dies with a deadlock error "instantly".
        #
        # This happened because shared NOWAIT locks were always taken
        # before exclusive locks. The problem is that the deadlock
        # error forced a transaction retry and prevented conflict
        # resolution. So we reverse the order and rely on NOWAIT to prevent
        # deadlocks. (We try to mitigate time spent
        # waiting to take exclusive locks by running a quick check for
        # readCurrent errors first). If there are no readCurrent
        # errors, we have a chance to fix any conflicts.
