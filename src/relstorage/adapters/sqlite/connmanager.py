    """
    SQLite doesn't really have isolation levels in the traditional
    sense; as far as that goes, it always operates in SERIALIZABLE
    mode. Instead, the connection's ``isolation_level`` parameter
    determines how autocommit behaves and the interaction between it
    at the SQLite and Python levels::

        - If it is ``None``, then the Python Connection object has nothing
          to do with transactions. SQLite operates in its default autocommit
          mode, beginning and ending a (read or write, as needed)
          transaction around every statement execution.

        - If it is set to IMMEDIATE or DEFERRED, than the Python
          Connection object watches each statement sent
          to ``Cursor.execute`` or ``Cursor.executemany`` to see
          if it's a DML statement (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE, and
          prior to Python 3.6, basically anything else except a
          SELECT). If it is, and the sqlite level is not already
          in a transaction, then the Connection begins a transaction
          of the specified type before executing the statement. The
          Connection COMMITs when commit() is called or when a DDL
          statement is executed (prior to Python 3.6).

    Now, those are all write statements that theoretically would begin
    a write transaction and take a database lock, so it would seem
    like there's no difference between IMMEDIATE and DEFERRED. But
    there is: recall that temporary tables are actually in a temporary
    *database*, so when you write to one of those, sqlite's internal
    transaction locks only apply to it. A DEFERRED transaction thus
    allows other connections to write to their own temporary tables,
    while an IMMEDIATE transaction blocks other from writing to their
    temporaries.

    We thus tell Python SQLite to operate in DEFERRED mode; for load
    connections, we must explicitly execute the BEGIN to get a
    consistent snapshot of the database, but for load, we can let the
    Python Connection detect when we execute a write operation and
    begin the transaction then, letting SQLite upgrade the locks to
    explicit mode when we attempt a write to the main database.

    Taking an exclusive lock on the main database can be accomplished
    with any UPDATE statement, even one that doesn't match any actual
    rows.
